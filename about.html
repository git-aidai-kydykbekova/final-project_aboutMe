        <div id="about-me-details-info">
        <p>My name is Aidai, and I wrote this essay about myself to tell my story and share my achievements.

            I love my job and I feel that it gives me the opportunity to grow and develop. I also continue to do volunteer work, helping organizations that deal with social issues.
            
            I consider one of my greatest achievements to be the fact that I was able to get out of my comfort zone and start volunteering. It wasn't easy for me, but I realized that only then can I really help other people and make the world a better place.
            My hobbies usually include traveling and photography. I like to explore new places and capture them in photos. I like to communicate with different people and learn about different cultures.
            
            I believe that everyone can make the world a better place by their actions. My goal in life is to help other people and contribute to the development of society. I try to always be open and kind to others, and help where necessary.
            
            In conclusion, I am proud of my achievements and the experience I have gained throughout my life. I strive to be the best version of myself and help other people. I am convinced that each of us can make the world a better place, and I hope that my actions contribute to this process.</p>
